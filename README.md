# BolTDL
Bolhuis' ToDo Lists: A tiny organization program with vim-like keybinds.

#Build
There are two ways to build. The first way is to open the solution with Visual Studio or something alike and build in release mode from there.

The other is with xbuild:
    git clone https://github.com/githuis/BolTDL.git
    cd BolTDL/BolTDL
    xbuild
